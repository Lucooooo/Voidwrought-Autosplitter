# Voidwrought Autosplitter & Load Remover
This has been tested with the following versions:

* v1.1.29 (Steam)

## Installation

When it will be added you will be able to simply enable the Autosplitter in the LiveSplit Splits Editor (while having Voidwrought entered as game).

Otherwise, you can also add it manually: [Download the script](), edit your LiveSplit Layout and add a Scriptable Autosplitter, then edit it's settings and select the downloaded file. Adding it manually can be useful if you want to edit the script yourself.

## Usage

The Autosplitter supports:

* Starting the timer when you start a New Game
* Load removal
  * Switch to Game Time in LiveSplit to see the timer pause when the game loads (Right-click on LiveSplit -> Compare Against -> Game Time)
  * Pause the Game Time also when going to the main menu
* Reset the run when starting a New Game with the timer still running 
* The automatic Start and Reset can be disabled
